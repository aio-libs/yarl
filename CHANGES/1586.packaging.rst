The in-tree build backend allows the end-users appending
``CFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS`` by setting respective environment
variables externally.

It additionally sets up default compiler flags to perform
building with maximum optimization in release mode. This
makes the resulting artifacts shipped to PyPI smaller.

When line tracing is requested, the compiler and linker
flags are configured to include as much information as
possible for debugging and coverage tracking. The
development builds are therefore smaller.
