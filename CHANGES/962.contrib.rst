It is now possible to request line tracing in Cython builds using the
``with-cython-tracing`` :pep:`517` config setting
-- :user:`webknjaz`.

This can be used in CI and development environment to measure coverage
on Cython modules, but is not normally useful to the end-users or
downstream packagers.

Here's a usage example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -Im pip install . --config-settings=with-cython-tracing=true

For editable installs, this setting is on by default. Otherwise, it's
off unless requested explicitly.
