Joining URLs with empty segments has been changed
to match :rfc:`3986`.

Previously empty segments would be removed from path,
breaking use-cases such as

.. code-block:: python

   URL("https://web.archive.org/web/") / "https://github.com/"

Now :meth:`/ <yarl.URL.__truediv__>` and :meth:`URL.joinpath() <yarl.URL.joinpath>` operation
keep empty segments, but do not introduce new empty segments.
e.g.

.. code-block:: python

   URL("https://example.org/") / ""

does not introduce an empty segment.
