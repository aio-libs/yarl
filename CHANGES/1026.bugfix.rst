Joining URLs with empty segments has been changed
to match :rfs:`3986`.
Previously empty segments would be removed from path,
breaking use-cases such as
URL("https://web.archive.org/web/") / "https://github.com/"
Now "/" and joinpath() operation keep empty segments,
but do not introduce new empty segments.
e.g.
URL("https://example.org/") / ""
does not introduce an empty segment.
