The default protocol ports of well-known URI schemes are now taken into account
during the normalization of the URL string representation in accordance with
:rfc:`3986#section-3.2.3`.

Specified ports are removed from the :class:`str` representation of a :class:`~yarl.URL`
if the port matches the scheme's default port -- by :user:`commonism`.
