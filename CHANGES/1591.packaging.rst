Starting this version, when building the wheels is happening
in an automatically created temporary directory, the build
backend makes an effort to normalize the respective file
system path to a deterministic source checkout directory.

It does so by injecting the ``-ffile-prefix-map`` compiler
option into the ``CFLAGS`` environment variable as suggested
by known `reproducible build practices
<https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/build-path/>`__.

The effect is that downstreams will get more reproducible
build results.
