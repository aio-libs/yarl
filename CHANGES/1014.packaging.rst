A flaw in the logic for copying the project directory into a
temporary folder that led to infinite recursion when :envvar:`TMPDIR`
was set to a project subdirectory path. This was happening in Fedora
and its downstream due to the use of `pyproject-rpm-macros
<https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros>`__. It was
only reproducible with ``pip wheel`` and was not affecting the
``pyproject-build`` users.
