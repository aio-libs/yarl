Made Cython line tracing opt-in via the ``with-cython-tracing`` build config setting -- by :user:`bdraco`.

Previously, line tracing was enabled by default in ``pyproject.toml``, which caused build issues for some users and made wheels nearly twice as slow.
Now line tracing is only enabled when explicitly requested via ``pip install . --config-setting=with-cython-tracing=true`` or by setting the ``YARL_CYTHON_TRACING`` environment variable.
