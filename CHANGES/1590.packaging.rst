The :pep:`517` build backend now supports a new config
setting for controlling whether to build the project in-tree
or in a temporary directory. It only affects wheels and is
set up to build in a temporary directory by default. It does
not affect editable wheel builds â€” they will keep being
built in-tree regardless.

Here's an example of using this setting:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m build \
       --config-setting=build-inplace=true
