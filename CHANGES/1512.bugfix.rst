Started raising a :exc:`ValueError` exception raised for corrupted
IPv6 URL values.

These fixes the issue where exception :exc:`IndexError` was
leaking from the internal code because of not being handled and
transformed into a user-facing error. The problem was happening
under the following conditions: empty IPv6 URL, brackets in
reverse order.
