:meth:`URL.join() <yarl.URL.join>` has been changed to match
:rfc:`3986` and align with
:meth:`/ operation <yarl.URL.__truediv__>` and :meth:`URL.joinpath() <yarl.URL.joinpath>`
when joining URLs with empty segments.
Previously :py:func:`urllib.parse.urljoin` was used,
which has known issues with empty segments
(`python/cpython#84774 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84774>`_).

Due to the semantics of :meth:`URL.join() <yarl.URL.join>`, joining an
URL with scheme requires making it relative, prefixing with ./.

.. code-block:: python

   URL("https://web.archive.org/web/").join(URL("./https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl"))


Empty segments are honored in the base as well as the joined part.

.. code-block:: python

   URL("https://web.archive.org/web/https://").join(URL("github.com/aio-libs/yarl"))
