Migrated to using a single cache for encoding hosts -- by :user:`bdraco`

Passing ``ip_address_size``, and ``host_validate_size`` to :py:meth:`~yarl.cache_configure` is deprecated in favor of the new ``encode_host`` parameter and will be removed in a future release.

The default cache size has been changed from ``256`` to ``512`` to account for combining the caches.

For backwards compatibility, the old parameters affect the ``encode_host`` cache size.
