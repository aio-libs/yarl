The leading ``--`` has been dropped from the :pep:`517` in-tree build
backend config setting names. ``--pure-python`` is now just ``pure-python``
-- by :user:`webknjaz`.

The usage now looks as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m build \
        --config-setting=pure-python=true \
        --config-setting=with-cython-tracing=true
