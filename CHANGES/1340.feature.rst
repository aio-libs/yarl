Added support for using the :meth:`subtraction operator <yarl.URL.__sub__>`
to get the relative path between URLs.

Note that both URLs must have the same scheme, user, password, host and port:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> target = URL("http://example.com/path/index.html")
   >>> base = URL("http://example.com/")
   >>> target - base
   URL('path/index.html')

URLs can also be relative:

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> target = URL("/")
  >>> base = URL("/path/index.html")
  >>> target - base
  URL('..')
