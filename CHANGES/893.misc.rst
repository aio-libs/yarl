Replaced the packaging is replaced from an old-fashioned :file:`setup.py` to an
in-tree :pep:`517` build backend -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

Whenever the end-users or downstream packagers need to build ``yarl`` from
source (a Git checkout or an sdist), they may pass a ``config_settings``
flag ``--pure-python``. If this flag is not set, a C-extension will be built
and included into the distribution.

Here is how this can be done with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install . --config-settings=--pure-python=

This will also work with ``-e | --editable``.

The same can be achieved via ``pypa/build``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m build --config-setting=--pure-python=

Adding ``-w | --wheel`` can force ``pypa/build`` produce a wheel from source
directly, as opposed to building an ``sdist`` and then building from it.
