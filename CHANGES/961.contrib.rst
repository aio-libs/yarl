Coverage collection has been implemented for the Cython modules
-- by :user:`webknjaz`.

It will also be reported to Codecov from any non-release CI jobs.

To measure coverage in a development environment, *yarl* can be
installed in editable mode, which requires an environment variable
``YARL_CYTHON_TRACING=1`` to be set:

.. code-block:: console

    $ YARL_CYTHON_TRACING=1 python -Im pip install -e .

Editable install produces C-files required for the Cython coverage
plugin to map the measurements back to the PYX-files.
