The CI has been updated to consistently benchmark optimized
release builds -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

When the release workflow is triggered, the pre-built wheels
ready to hit PyPI are being tested. Otherwise, the job
builds the project from source, while the rest of the
workflow uses debug builds for line tracing and coverage
collection.
