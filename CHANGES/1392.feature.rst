Added a new method :py:meth:`~yarl.URL.relative_to`
to get the relative path between URLs.

Note that both URLs must have the same scheme, user, password, host and port:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> target = URL("http://example.com/path/index.html")
   >>> base = URL("http://example.com/")
   >>> target.relative_to(base)
   URL('path/index.html')
   >>> base.relative_to(target)
   URL('..')

URLs can also be relative:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> target = URL("/path/index.html")
   >>> base = URL("/")
   >>> target.relative_to(base)
   URL('path/index.html')
   >>> base.relative_to(target)
   URL('..')
