Introduction
------------

Url is constructed from ``str``:

   >>> from yarl import URL
   >>> url = URL('https://www.python.org/~guido?arg=1#frag')
   >>> url
   URL('https://www.python.org/~guido?arg=1#frag')

All url parts: *scheme*, *user*, *passsword*, *host*, *port*, *path*,
*query* and *fragment* are accessible by properties:

   >>> url.scheme
   'https'
   >>> url.host
   'www.python.org'
   >>> url.path
   '/~guido'
   >>> url.query_string
   'arg=1'
   >>> url.query
   <MultiDictProxy('arg': '1')>
   >>> url.fragment
   'frag'

All url manipulations produces a new url object:

   >>> url.parent / 'downloads/source'
   URL('https://www.python.org/downloads/source')

Strings passed to constructor and modification methods are
automatically encoded giving canonical representation as result:

.. doctest::

   >>> url = URL('https://www.python.org/путь')
   >>> url
   URL('https://www.python.org/%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C')

Regular properties are *percent-encoded*, use ``raw_`` versions for
getting *decoded* strings:

   >>> url.path
   '/путь'

   >>> url.raw_path
   '/%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C'

Human readable representation of URL is available as ``.human_repr()``:

   >>> url.human_repr()
   'https://www.python.org/путь'

Comparison with other URL libraries
------------------------------------

* furl (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/furl)

  The libray has a rich functionality but ``furl`` object is mutable.

  I afraid to pass this object into foreign code: who knows if the
  code will modifiy my url in a terrible way while I just want to send URL
  with handy helpers for accessing URL properies.

  ``furl`` has other non obvious tricky things but the main objection
  is mutability.

* URLObject (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/URLObject)

  URLObject is immutable, that's pretty good.

  Every URL change generates a new URL object.

  But the library doesn't any decode/encode transormations leaving end
  user to cope with these gory details.
